# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
Various weather data for 2000 randomly generated sets of latitudes and longitudes was retrieved using the CitiPy module. OpenWeather API requests were made for each successfully identified city and the resulting JSON was parsed for the desired metrics and stored in [WeatherPy_Database.csv](weather_database/WeatherPy_Database.csv). Then, user input statements for minimum and maximum temperatures identified destinations within customer preferences and displayed as pop up markers on a map, detailing nearby hotels and current weather descriptions. A travel itinerary was generated from this filtered list of destinations and a travel route between four cities was displayed as a marker layer.
